            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
            applications include a Do-Not-Track ( 'DNT' ) feature or setting you
            can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
            about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
            this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and
            implementing DNT signals has been finalised . As such, we do not
            currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
            automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If
            a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
            future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version
            of this Privacy Notice.

            California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web
